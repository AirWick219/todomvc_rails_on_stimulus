    <p>Stimulus is a JavaScript framework with modest ambitions. It doesn't seek to take over your entire front-endâ€”in fact, it's not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.</p>
